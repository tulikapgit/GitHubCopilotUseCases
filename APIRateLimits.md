The following Python code fetches weather data from an external API. If the API has rate limits, requests may fail when limits are exceeded, and your app may need a way to handle these responses gracefully by implementing retry logic.

```python
from flask import Flask, request
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

WEATHER_API_URL = "https://api.example.com/weather"

@app.route('/get_weather', methods=['GET'])
def get_weather():
    city = request.args.get('city')
    # Simulate an API request to the external weather service
    response = requests.get(WEATHER_API_URL, params={"city": city})
    weather_data = response.json() 

    return weather_data
```

Example prompt:
How can I handle API rate limits within get_weather().
